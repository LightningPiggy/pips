# PIP-0001: Custom Hardware HAT
## Motivation
The LILYGO T5 e-paper device, while still functional and in production, has several limitations that hinder its suitability for the intended application. These issues include:
1. Outdated Connectivity: The device relies on a Micro USB connector for power and data transfer. With USB-C now the industry standard, the current interface is outdated.
2. Suboptimal Connector Placement: The Micro USB port is positioned perpendicular to the screen with only a few millimetres of clearance, restricting case design options.
3. Limited Power Supply Options: Besides the Micro USB port, the device offers a JST 1.25mm battery connector. This small, less common connector lacks a standardised pin polarity, necessitating extra checks before battery attachment. Moreover, there’s no provision for using a AAA battery holder (3) or solar panel.
4. Risk of Obsolescence: The outdated power and data connectivity increases the risk of obsolescence, emphasising the need for a more future-proof solution.
5. Soldering Requirements for Additional Features: Adding features such as a shake-to-wake switch, speaker, or LEDs requires soldering, which is a barrier for many young or inexperienced builders.
## Implementation Options
### 1. Keep the LILYGO T5 board and develop a custom hardware HAT.
#### Pros
- Minimal disruption in the short term.
#### Cons
- Risk of obsolescence for the ESP32 ‘mainboard’ remains.
- Outdated Micro USB connector remains.
- JST 1.25mm connector still requires extra polarity checks.
- Higher cost per unit compared to Options 2 and 3.
### 2. Replace the LILYGO T5 board with an ESP32 S2 Mini plus WeAct 2.13 inch B/W ePaper display and develop a fully featured custom hardware HAT.
#### Pros
- Solves all motivating factors.
- S2 Mini (1) + WeAct 2.13 inch B/W ePaper display (2) costs less than $4 USD.
#### Cons
- Requires additional software and hardware development.
- Involves assembling three components instead of two.
### 3. Develop a custom ESP32 powered board with an integrated ePaper display and all required inputs and outputs for the project.
#### Pros
- Reduced development time and risk.
- Fewer assembly steps.
- Unique product.
#### Cons
- High cost.
- Requires additional software and hardware development.
### Required Features
#### Board Features
- Over-voltage protection for all inputs and outputs.
- Reverse polarity protection to safeguard against incorrect power supply connections.
#### Inputs & Outputs
- Power and Data: At least one USB-C connector, with an additional USB-C port positioned perpendicular to the screen for versatile design options.
- Battery Power: Connector for an AAA battery holder (3).
- Solar Power: Dedicated connector for solar power integration.
- Tilt Switch: Connector for a tilt switch.
- LEDs: Connector for LED integration.
- Audio: Connector for an audio speaker.
- Solder-Free Design: Utilises solder-free connections wherever possible, such as hammer pin (4), press-fit pin (5), or spring-loaded connectors (6).
